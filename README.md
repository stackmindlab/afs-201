Pythong Programming Class (OOP Programming)
This is a BU AFS-200 python course. 
The instructor for this course is one of the best Programmers I know (Mr. Robert).
Words will never express my gratitude towards him. He's more than an instructor that just throws assignments at you.
He takes time to explain and guide you, yet challenges and unlocks the potential.
This is his programming with python OOP class repo.
